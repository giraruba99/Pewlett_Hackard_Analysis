# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis!
In this projects we are using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4 to analyze 6 big CSV files of Pewlett Hackard. We were provided a big sum of unfiltered data about employees, their titles, salaries, departments, department managers and each department employees. 

From those hundred thousands rows of data, we are filtering out who is retiring and when. We anticipate the company to use this analysis in mapping out when to hire and to which department. Since they need more time to train a new department manager, we are also filtering our department manager's retirement dates.
